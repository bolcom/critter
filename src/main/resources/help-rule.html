<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>
A rule can have actions that change the request, headers, body or those of the response.
All its actions are performed in the order as listed in the rule.
A rule has a name and can be disabled. Rules are defined in XML.
Rules are managed (crud) using the REST interface of the traffic service.
